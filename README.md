# ESDL Documentation

## Current state

ESDL is still being heavily developed, with new versions being released periodically. We are using ESDL in many different projects now to get experience in using it and collect feedback. Some parts are still subject to discussion. Feel free to start using it, but some things will definitely change in the coming months.

## ESDL Documentation

This documentation contains the following chapters:

* [Introduction](introduction.md): General introduction into what ESDL is and for what purposes it can be used.
* [Energy Data Modelling](https://github.com/EnergyTransition/ESDL-gitbook/tree/c95a6932082308f1aaabbc8a6738b9670490fb64/energy-data-modelling.md): Explanation of the general concepts of Energy Data Modelling
* [ESDL concepts](esdl-concepts/): Explanation of the what and why of different parts of the ESDL language
* [How to use ESDL](how-to-use-esdl.md): Explanation of how to use ESDL, practical tips
* [Tooling for ESDL](tooling-for-esdl/): Explanation of tooling to contribute to the developments of ESDL, to use ESDL to model an energy system and to integrate ESDL in your own tooling
* [Examples](examples/): Several examples of how ESDL can be applied
