# Contributing to the ESDL model

To contribute to the ESDL language you have to install Eclipse and the Eclipse Modeling Tools which contain the Eclipse Modeling Framework.

These can be downloaded from the eclipse.org website. Easiest is downloading the modeling package directly with a new Eclipse installation, but alternatively you could also install these modeling tools as plugins in your existing Eclipse installation. Since EMF is still under active development, and ESDL is using new features from these latest releases, it is required to use the lastest version of Eclipse.

Currently Oxygen 3a is the latest stable release of Eclipse. The complete package can be downloaded [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-modeling-tools/oxygen3a).
