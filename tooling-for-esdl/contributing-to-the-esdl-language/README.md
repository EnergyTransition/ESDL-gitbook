# Contributing to the ESDL language

To contribute to the ESDL language you have to install Eclipse and the Eclipse Modeling Tools which contain the Eclipse Modeling Framework.

These can be downloaded from the eclipse.org website. Easiest is downloading the modeling package directly with a new Eclipse installation, but alternatively you could also install these modeling tools as plugins in your existing Eclipse installation. Since EMF is still under active development, and ESDL is using new features from these latest releases, it is required to use the lastest version of Eclipse.

Currently Oxygen 3a is the latest stable release of Eclipse. The complete package can be downloaded [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-modeling-tools/oxygen3a).

## Setting up Eclipse Modeling Tools

After downloading and installing Eclipse and Eclipse Modeling Tools, you can import the ESDL git repository by using File -&gt; Import... Select the location where you've cloned the repository and the project will be imported. 

In the package explorer you will see the following files:
