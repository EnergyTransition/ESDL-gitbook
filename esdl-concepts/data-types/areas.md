# Areas

The Area class represents a physical geographic area or a more abstract logical area. In both cases it is the 'asset container', in a sense that all assets within the area are contained by the Area instance. A physical geographic area is a specific area with a location and geometry \(and can be pointed at on a map\). A logical area can be an non-specific area, like 'a neighbourhood with houses from the period 1970-1990' without specifically stating where this neighbourhood is located.

An area can have a scope \(like country, region, city, village, street, building and lots more\) and have a type \(like land, road, water, sea, ...\). An area can be subdivided into smaller areas, like a city that is divided into neighbourhoods and neighbourhoods being divided into streets.

Areas can have the following properties:

* Location and geometry
* EnergyPotential \(wind, solar PV, geothermal, aquifer, ...\)
* Legal restrictions
* Social properties
* Economic properties
