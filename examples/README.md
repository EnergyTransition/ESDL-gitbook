# Examples

The variety of possible applications of ESDL is enormous. The language allows both very detailed descriptions \(individual house level\) as very high level descriptions \(national level\). This sections will show some examples of applications of ESDL to give an expression of the possibilities.

Examples are:

* [Describing a municipality](describing-a-municipality.md)
* [Describing a house](describing-a-house.md)
