# Applications and Example ESDL descriptions

The variety of possible applications of ESDL is enormous, both from an application perspective as from what you can model. The language allows both very detailed descriptions \(individual house level\) as very high level descriptions \(national level\). This sections will show some examples of applications of ESDL to give an impression of the possibilities.

## Example tooling

During the last two years different software applications have been developped based on ESDL:

* [MapEditor](examples/mapeditor.md): Map based energy system scenario editor
* [ESSIM](examples/essim.md): Energy System Simulator
* [EDR](examples/energy-data-repository.md): Energy Data Repository
* ESSIM financial: Gives insight in the effects of investments in the energy system of one or more stakeholders on the cashflows between all stakeholders in this system
* ESDL based loadflow calculation of electricity grids

## Example projects

Current projects that we are involved in with external partners are:

* WarmingUp: connecting plan and design phases for district heating networks using ESDL
* Mondaine: coupling of Energy Transition Models using ESDL
* Energy Potential Scan for Business Parks: calculating business cases for building and district wide interventions in the energy system
* ESDL based heat loss calculation model
* ESDL based gas network simulations

## Example data

Examples of data in ESDL are:

* [Describing a house](describing-a-house.md)
* [Describing a municipality](describing-a-municipality.md)
* [Describing a profile](describing-a-profile.md)

More examples will be added in the coming months.
